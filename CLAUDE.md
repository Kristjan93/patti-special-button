# pattiSpecialButton

A macOS menu bar app. A wiggling animated butt lives in the menu bar and plays a fart sound when clicked. Choose from 47 different butt icons by Pablo Stanley.

## What it does

- **Menu bar icon**: An animated butt that wiggles continuously in the macOS menu bar (variable frame count per butt, 0.1s per frame).
- **Left-click (tap)**: Plays a short fart sound (minimum 0.5s so the first fart always completes).
- **Left-click (hold)**: Keeps playing farts in a loop for as long as the mouse is held. Loops back to start if held past end of file.
- **Right-click menu**: Shows a context menu with a Quit option.
- **No Dock icon**: Pure menu bar app — no Dock presence, no main window. Configured via `LSUIElement = YES`.

## Architecture

Hybrid SwiftUI + AppKit. SwiftUI provides the `@main` app lifecycle, but all menu bar logic is in AppKit via `@NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor`.

- `pattiSpecialButtonApp.swift` — App entry point. Wires up AppDelegate, uses `Settings { EmptyView() }` as a no-window scene.
- `AppDelegate.swift` — Core logic: `NSStatusItem` setup, `DispatchSourceTimer` animation, `AVAudioPlayer` playback with hold-to-play.
- `StatusItemMouseView` (in AppDelegate.swift) — Transparent `NSView` subclass overlaid on the status bar button. Intercepts `mouseDown`/`mouseUp`/`rightMouseUp` to bypass `NSStatusBarButton`'s tracking loop which swallows `mouseUp` events.

### Why StatusItemMouseView exists

`NSStatusBarButton` enters a modal tracking loop on mouseDown that consumes `leftMouseUp` events. Neither `sendAction(on:)`, local event monitors, nor any AppKit event dispatch mechanism receives the mouseUp. The fix is a custom `NSView` added as a subview on top of the button — `NSView` guarantees `mouseUp` is delivered to the same view that received `mouseDown`.

### How frame loading works

`AppDelegate.loadFrameImages()` loads frames from the app bundle at runtime using `Bundle.main.url(forResource:withExtension:subdirectory:)`. It looks up the selected butt's subfolder inside `ButtFrames/`, then iterates `frame_00.png`, `frame_01.png`, ... until no more files are found. Each frame is set to 20x20 points, marked `isTemplate = true` for automatic menu bar tinting. The frame count is dynamic per butt (not hardcoded).

## Sound

- **File**: `556505__jixolros__small-realpoots105-110.wav` — contains multiple short farts with 0.4s gaps, trimmed from original freesound.org recording.
- **Playback**: `AVAudioPlayer` with `numberOfLoops = -1` (infinite loop). Starts on mouseDown, stops on mouseUp with a 0.5s minimum play duration enforced via `DispatchWorkItem`.

### Swapping the sound

1. Drop a new sound file into the `pattiSpecialButton/` directory
2. Update the `Bundle.main.url(forResource:withExtension:)` call in `AppDelegate.swift` to match the new filename
3. Adjust `minimumPlayDuration` if needed to match the new sound's timing

## Assets

- `ButtFrames/` — Xcode folder reference (added to project outside the auto-synced source group to preserve directory hierarchy in the bundle). Contains 47 butt subfolders, each with numbered grayscale 40x40 PNG frames, plus a `manifest.json`. Generated by `buttsss/brazilian-butt-lift.py`.
- `buttsss/fractured-but-whole/` — Source animated GIFs (512x512, black line art on white, by Pablo Stanley).
- `buttsss/brazilian-butt-lift.py` — Python script (Pillow) that extracts GIF frames, converts to grayscale, resizes to 40x40, and outputs into `ButtFrames/`. See `buttsss/README.md` for setup and usage.

### Adding a new butt

1. Drop the GIF into `buttsss/fractured-but-whole/`
2. Run `cd buttsss && source .venv/bin/activate && python3 brazilian-butt-lift.py`
3. Build in Xcode — the folder reference picks up changes automatically

### Why grayscale (not alpha-based) template images

macOS template rendering (`isTemplate = true`) reads grayscale luminance directly when there is no alpha channel: dark pixels are visible, white pixels are invisible. The existing frames are single-channel grayscale PNGs with no alpha — this just works. A future enhancement (TODO in the script) could convert to RGBA with alpha-based transparency for more precise rendering.
